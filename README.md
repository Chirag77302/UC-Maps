# Graph Implementation

A real life application of graph datastructure. Javafx project which uses advanced graph algorithms to find the shortest path between source and destination place in maps. UI is provided by UCSanDiego.

## Outline

1. Implemented Graphs in Java from scratch.
2. Analyzed the performance of different implementations of Graphs.
3. Worked with Java's built-in classes for fundamental data structures including: HashSet, HashMap, and PriorityQueue.
4. Designed classes to solve a high-level process, including fields, methods, and inheritance relationships.
5. Described and implemented several algorithms for graph search.
6. Evaluated the performance of different graph search algorithms in different contexts.
7. Used graphs and graph algorithms to plan routes using real data.
